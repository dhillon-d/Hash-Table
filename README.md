# Hash Map
Purpose of this assignment was to create a hash map implementation in C. To achieve this a "hash function" is used which essentially
"translates" a string into an integer. However this integer aims to be as unique as possible for different strings. This allows different
strings to be "mapped" to different indices in the hash map.
## Anagram Implementation
In addition to creating a hash map, string anagrams are to be mapped to the same indices in a linked list fashion.
## How to build
"make main"  
"make run_main"
## How to run
After executing the program type in a word and the program will print out all possible anagrams of given word.
